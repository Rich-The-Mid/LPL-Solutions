According to the first premiss, all objects of this world are cubes OR they all are tetrahedrons OR they all are dodecahedrons. Let's say that there is an arbitrary object "a" that is a cube and an arbitrary object "b". By the first premiss, "b" is a cube, so it has the same shape as "a" (applying axiom 5). Since "a" and "b" are arbitrary and axiom 6 and axiom 7 implies the same shape property for dodecahedrons and tetrahedrons, then any two objects of this world will have this property of having the same shape.

The premiss says that an object called "b" has the same shape as an object called "c". If "b" is a cube, by axiom 8, "c" is also a cube (so "c" has the same shape as "b"). If "b" is a dodecahedron, by the axiom 9, "c" is also a dodecahedron (so "c" has the same shape as "b"). If "b" is a tetrahedron, by the axiom 10, "c" is also a tetrahedron (so "c" has the same shape as "b"). Since the fact that all objects must be a cube, a dodecahedron or a tetrahedron (axiom 4), we can conclude that in this world "c" will always have the same shape as "b".

The first premiss says that all objects of this world are cubes, dodecahedrons, or both. The second premiss says that all cubes are large, and the third premiss says that there is an object that is not large. Let "c" be this object that is not large, so by the first and second premisses, c can't be a cube and the only available option is dodecahedron, so we conclude that there is an object that is a dodecahedron.

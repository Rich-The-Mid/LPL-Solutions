Let's suppose that is true that there are two objects in this world that are cubes and one is to the right of the other. Let "a" and "b" be such cubes with "a" to the right of "b", which implies that "b" is to the left of "a", but by the first premiss, if an object is to the left of another, it has a larger size. However, the second premiss says that all cubes are small. Contradiction. We can conclude there isn't two cubes in this world with one to the right of the other.

By the axiom 4, every block must be a cube, a tetrahedron or a dodecahedron. Let's suppose that there is an arbitrary object called "c" in this world. By the first premiss, there is an object that is not a cube or a dodecahedron. Let's suppose that "c" is this object. Applying the axiom 4, "c" is then a tetrahedron. The second premiss says that there is an object that has the same shape as all the other objects, let's again suppose that "c" is this object. We can conclude that all objects in this world have the same shape as "c", which means that all objects are tetrahedrons. Since the fact that "c" is an arbitrary object, we can assume this for all objects.

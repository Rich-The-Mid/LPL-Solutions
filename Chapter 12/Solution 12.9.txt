The first premiss says that this world is composed by large cubes, small tetrahedrons, or both. The second premiss says that if an object is a tetrahedron, then it is on the back of an object called "c" (by the premiss 1, we infer that "c" is a cube, because an object can't be on the back of itself). Let "d" be an arbitrary object that is small. By the first premiss, "d" is a tetrahedron and by the second, then, "d" is behind "c". But since "d" is an arbitrary chosen small tetrahedron, this property happens for all small tetrahedrons. We can conclude that all small objects are on the back of "c".

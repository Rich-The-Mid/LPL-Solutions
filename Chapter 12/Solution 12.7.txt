The first premiss says that this world is composed by cubes, dodecahedrons, or both. The second premiss says that all cubes are large and there is an object "c" that is to the left of all of them. The third premiss says that all objects that are not small are tetrahedrons, but we can't have tetrahedrons in this world, so there will be no non-small objects, which implies that there will be no cubes in this world. Since we need an object "c", the only available shape for it is dodecahedron, so we can conclude that there is at least one dodecahedron in this world.
